# General Troubleshooting
When you first plug in your JukeBox device, before it connects to the desktop application, it will show you several important elements.

First, a box on the bottom left to indicate USB connectivity. This box will be red if the device cannot exchange information with the host computer, which can happen if your USB cable or port malfunctions. Try using another port, another orientation, or another cable. The box will be green if the device and host computer are communicating.

Second, a unique identifier (UID) will appear at the bottom middle of the screen. This string of letters and numbers uniquely identifies this JukeBox, and is determined by the flash storage chip used on the device. This UID will also appear in your desktop application.

Third, a firmware version number in the bottom right. It's good practice to always make sure your device is up-to-date. If your device can connect to the desktop application, you can [update your device using the desktop application](flashing-firmware.md#1-updating-via-the-desktop-application). If for whatever reason the device can be detected by the host computer, but not the desktop application, you may need to [manually flash the firmware](flashing-firmware.md#2-manually-flashing-new-firmware-on-tour-device).
