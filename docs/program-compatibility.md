# Program Compatibility
This file is to document what programs work with the JukeBox's F13-F24 keys, sorted alphabetically. These programs were tested on Windows.

If another program is confirmed to work without issue, or has problems with the JukeBox, consider opening an issue or submitting a PR.

[^discord]: Discord will only display the correct key name for F13-F19, the rest will be displayed as UNK131-UNK135. The keys still function as expected regardless of this error.
[^love2d]: LÖVE 11.x supports the full range of keys. Older versions only support a limited number of keys, such as 0.6.2 only supporting F13-F15.
[^enginesoftware]: This tag indicates the software supports or does not support recieving key events related to the JukeBox keys. This does not guarantee all products made with this software will or will not support usage of the JukeBox, but is very likely to affect said products in the same way.
